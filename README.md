In this project, we'll learn how to start with data analysis using Python. The main Python packages we will use are:

- **numpy** 
- **pandas**
The dataset we'll work with is the IPL (Indian Premier League) Dataset, which you can find on Kaggle. It's sourced from cricsheet. All project files are taken from Kaggle.
